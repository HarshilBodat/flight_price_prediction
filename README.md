### Flight Price Prediction

Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting flight prices using various machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to help users find the best time to book flights by forecasting future flight prices based on historical data. This project is designed to be run on cloud platforms for scalability and accessibility.

#### Project Overview

Flight prices can vary significantly based on various factors such as time of booking, seasonality, and demand. This project aims to build predictive models that can analyze historical flight price data and forecast future prices, providing valuable insights for travelers looking to optimize their flight booking decisions.

#### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles cleaning and preprocessing of flight price data.
  - Converts raw data into suitable formats for model training and evaluation.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracts relevant features from the data such as date, departure time, arrival time, and airline.
  - Creates new features to enhance model performance.

- **Model Training**:
  - Implements various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Trains models on historical flight price data to learn patterns and trends.

- **Price Prediction**:
  - Provides flight price predictions based on the trained models.
  - Outputs predicted prices for given flight search criteria.

- **Evaluation and Metrics**:
  - Includes evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
  - Compares results across different models to select the best-performing one.
